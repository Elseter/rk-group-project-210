# Project Name: Dockerized FlaskBackend API with MySQL and ReactJS

Welcome to the Dockerized FlaskBackend API with MySQL and ReactJS project! This project provides a seamless integration of FlaskBackend API with MySQL database, all orchestrated by Docker Compose. Additionally, it includes a ReactJS server for front-end interaction.

## Prerequisites
Before running this project, ensure that you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine.

### Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash git clone https://github.com/yourusername/project-name.git```
Navigate to the project directory:
```bash cd project-name```
Build and run the Docker Compose stack:
```css docker-compose up --build```
Once the containers are up and running, you can access the FlaskBackend API at http://localhost:5050 and the ReactJS server at http://localhost:3000.
## Configuration
FlaskBackend API: The Flask application is configured in the flaskBackendSQL directory. You can modify the Flask app code in app.py and add your routes, controllers, and models as needed.
MySQL Database: The MySQL database is configured in the mysql service of the docker-compose.yml file. You can modify the database configuration (e.g., database name, username, password) in this file.
ReactJS Server: The ReactJS application is configured in the group5 directory. You can modify the React components and add your front-end logic in this directory.
## Usage
FlaskBackend API Endpoints: Define your API endpoints in the Flask application and access them using HTTP requests.
MySQL Database Interaction: Use the MySQL database for storing and retrieving data. Ensure that the FlaskBackend API endpoints are configured to interact with the database as needed.
ReactJS Frontend: Build your front-end user interface using React components. Make API requests to the FlaskBackend API endpoints to fetch and manipulate data.
